# Starting out

whenever you're starting with node, you're
gonna create package.json file

<br>

to create a package.json file, type this in your
terminal

```
npm init
```

or if you wanna do without custom config:

```
npm init -y
```

## Installing your first npm package

we're gonna install a package called uuid
which is bassically gonna make a random id

<br>

to install, in your terminal:

```
npm i uuid
```

### note:

we're installing this locally on our current
project only. You can see in your package.json
that uuid is installed as a dependency

<br>

## Dev dependency

dependency that is just needed for development

<br>

we're gonna install nodemon, in your terminal:

```
npm i --save-dev nodemon
```

OR

```
npm i -D nodemon
```

### note:

nodemon is so that you don't type

```
node [your program]
```

everytime you updates your program

## Installing node dependencies if the node_modules didn't exist yet

to install the dependencies in package.json
you have to enter this in your terminal:

```
npm i
```

## package-lock.json

this tracks all of our dependencies with its
versions, also the dependencies that
is inside those dependencies

<br>

everything comes from [npmjs.com] repo

[npmjs.com]: https://www.npmjs.com/
