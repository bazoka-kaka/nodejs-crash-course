# INTRODUCTIONS

## what is nodejs

- javascript runtime (not a language or framework)
  the language is javascript, but instead
  of running it on the browser, it runs on the machine

- built on V8 javascript engine (same as google chrome)

- written in c++

- bassically allows us to run javascript code in the server

## prerequisites

- javascript fundamentals
- http
- json
- arrow functions
- promises
- mvc pattern

## Why use nodejs?

- fast, efficient, highly scalable
- event driven, non blocking I/O model
- popular in the industry
- same language on the front and backend (JS)
  MERN (Mongodb, EJS, React, Nodejs)

### note:

not like you have python for backend
and javascript on backend, but you have
both javascript as frontend and backend

## Nonblocking I/O

- works on a single thread
  using nonblocking I/O
- supports tens of thousands current connections
- optimizes throughput & scalability in apps with
  many I/O operations
- all of this makes nodejs apps very fast & efficient

### note:

something like php is usually synchronous and
it's running on multiple threads
these threads can max out (waiting one process to complete
before starting the next)

while nodejs is asynchronous and is working on a single thread
this single thread could support tens of thousands of connections
which are held in something called event loop

you don't wanna use node in a cpu with intensive apps

## Node's event loop

- single threaded
- supports concurency
  via events & callbacks
- EventEmitter class is used
  to bind events and listeners

## Best types of projects for node

- REST API & Microservices
- Real time services (chat, live updates)
- CRUD Apps
  (blogs, shopping carts, social networks)
- Tools and utilities

short answer: anything that is not CPU intensive

## NPM (Node Package Manager)

- install 3rd party packages
  (frameworks, libraries, tools, etc)
- packages get stored in "node_modules" folder
- all dependecies
  are listed
  in a "package.json" file
- npm scripts can be created to
  run certain tasks
  such as running a server

```
npm init
npm install express
npm install -g nodemon
```

### note:

npm init --> generates a package.json file
npm install express --> installs a package locally
npm install -g nodemon --> installs a package globally

## Node Modules

- node core modules (path, fs, http, etc)
- 3rd party modules/packages installed via NPM
- custom modules (files)

```
const path = require('path');
const myFile = require('./myFile');
```
